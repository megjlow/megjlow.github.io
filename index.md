### Welcome to GitHub Pages for Tiles for Tales.

Information about the Tiles for Tales project is available here:  [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales)

The project uses NodeMCU boards using the capabilities of the ESP8266.  Each tile has is controlled by a board, running the Tilenet software.  

### Create a Tile
The original project used cardboard and felt to create individual tiles, but a mixture of materials can be used.  More information can be found at [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales/CreateTile](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales/CreateTile)

### Using ScratchX with NodeMCU board
To use the ScratchX extension to communicate with the board, the steps are here: [http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales/UsingScratchX](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/TilesForTales/UsingScratchX)
